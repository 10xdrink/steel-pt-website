              We believe fitness isn't about suffering through workouts you hate. It's about 
              building a body and mind that serve you for life.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
              Founded by Kunal Gir in 2015, Steel emerged from a simple observation: most 
              fitness approaches fail because they focus on short-term results instead of 
              lasting transformation.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
              We built Steel to be different. Every program, every coach, every piece of 
              equipment is designed around one goal â€” your long-term success.
